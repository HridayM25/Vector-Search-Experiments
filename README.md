# Vector-Search-Experiments
Experiments related to Vector Search, mainly exploring the implications of a Research Paper.

Tested the accuracy of the findings of the research paper (https://bib.dbvis.de/uploadedFiles/155.pdf) on my own data. 

Also tried using SPLADE which is a Sparse Lexical and Expansion Model for Information Retrieval. Further details are here : https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.10086
